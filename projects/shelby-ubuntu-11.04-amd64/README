This is a vagrant project for creating a box ready to install and run the Shelby rails app on Ubuntu 11.04 for amd64.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you want to modify and repackage the box, there is a fix needed to allow host only networking to work on
the newly packaged box:

Just before packaging the box, ssh into the running VM and delete /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  This
will prevent the packaged box from having an improper MAC address set on its interfaces when booting up.

This fix was found at: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/454

Here's how to update the VirtualBox Guest Additions if you've got a newer version of VirtualBox than the one your
vagrant box was packaged for:
